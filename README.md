# Hacker News take home

This is the take home test for Revelio Labs

To run, clone the repo and run

`yarn` and `yarn dev`

This should have all of the requested features as well as the 2 bonus features.

As a take home... I liked it. It feels very "real world". Hopefully it is what you are looking for.
